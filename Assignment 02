### User testing
GoNannies.com is a website for seniors to find caregivers to help them in their old age. Users are able to filter and sort caregivers based on location, age, living arrangement, availability, language, experience, and more. Users are then able to contact the nannies for employment or add them to a watchlist for future reference. 

We will be performing a usability test for GoNannies.com to evaluate how effective and efficient the site is to navigate and complete tasks with. Through this test, we will be able to identify any flaws in usability to see what works well with the site and what is ineffective. The usability test will be recorded for behavioral analysis. In the test, users were asked to complete three tasks which included 1) 

In the heuristic analysis I conducted on GoNannies.com, I found several usability issues. The first one was the overall aesthetic of the website. I found the website to be messy and cluttered, which may pose threats for seniors who are unfamiliar with technology. The font is also very small and sometimes the color of the words do not contrast the background enough. The second one was a lack of user control and freedom. There are no options for undo or redo buttons, and oftentimes no error prevention measures for submitting forms. Lastly, there is barely any communication with users about the status of the system and it is difficult for users to guage where they are and how the system is functioning.

For my usability test, I performed it in my apartment using my personal laptop. I used ActivePresenter to record my usability test. The session recorded the screen, me and the user, and audio. This usability test is a pilot test, and my roommate was the user.

The process of the usability test was as follows:
- Intro
- Background questions
- Previous experience questions
- Pre-test questions
- Tasks
- Post-test questions
- SUS questionnaire
- Product satisfaction card
- Demographics

The following results were measured (many using the seven-point Likert scale):
- Ease of use
- Frequency of use
- Learn ability
- Trustworthiness
- Site organization
- Site content
- How the user felt after using site

## Improving user testing
During the pilot test, I learned what usability issues existed for Yelp. For example, I saw that it was not very intuitive for users to filter locations by hours of operation. I also learned that some of Yelp's capabilities, like collections, are incredibly difficult to find. What went well was that there was a mutual trust between the participant and moderator. The testing environment was also quiet. What did not go well was that I was unsure what to do when the user could not complete a certain task and that the internet connection was slow. In future usability tests, I will be more encouraging to the participant and ask them to speak out loud mo I would also perform the usability test in a more test-like environment rather than my dre.orm room. The pilot test was able to show me how users navigate the site and learn what parts of the site pose as usability errors.
