# Making School and Weather More Accessible  
## Emily DiPressi - Digital Humanities 150

The CCLE app was an easy choice for me, because when I first heard about the CCLE app I was very excited because I thought it was going to be something valuable and would be easier to navigate on my phone rather than the myUCLA webpage on Safari. When I first downloaded the app, however, and tried to use it, I was unimpressed, mostly by the lack of synchronization that the app had with the webpage version. The National Weather Service page was also an easy choice for me because I have started my day by looking at the weather for as long and I can remember. Throughout my years I have come across good and bad weather websites, so to evaluate the official site was a good choice. Initially the webpage seemed very overwhelming and dated. It had a lot of options to click on even on just the first page and seemed very intimidating before I started searching for anything. Each of these sites need many improvements.    

### CCLE Mobile 
*The CCLE Mobile App is used in conjunction with the UCLA web CCLE (Common Collaboration and Learning Environment) page. It is the page where students access their course websites and materials such as a syllabus and readings. Assignments are submitted through here and grades are given here as well. It is a page where the instructor can give out information to the class as a whole.*

#### Evaluation
*Overall: The CCLE Mobile App has a long way to go until it measures up to the CCLE webpage. There are many striking issues and the major one being that it is not properly synched to the students schedule. If all current classes are not on the app, there is no reason in the first place to use the app. In its current state the app is not used to its full capacity. There are many consistency errors that need to be fixed along with ease of usability.*

Heuristic & Description | CCLE Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement 
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------
**Visibility of system status:** The web/app gives the user feedback in a timely manner concerning the actions they are currently doing. | **Good:** Has loading circle visible. Bottom icon is highlighted to show you where you are. **Bad:** The app is not updated to show my current courses. I have a mixture of courses from Fall, Winter, and Spring (the current quarter). | **Improvement:** Make sure the app is fully linked or synched to be reflective of the CCLE online page and what the student is currently enrolled in.
**Match between system and real world:** Design and icons are based off of general knowledge. Things the user will easily recognize. | **Bad:** The graph at the bottom is not necessarily reflective of grades, not as easily recognizable. Within calendar there is a funnel, which has an unclear meaning - it means other classes. Three dots in calendar takes you to settings and that goes to a setting of notification time. | **Improvement:** The graph could be changed to an A+ symbol. The funnel could be a plus (indicating for more) or three dots. The notification time setting can be better, since there is only one option in settings, to have a different icon of a bell is better for notifications.
**User control and freedom:** User has options, such as undo or redo. | **Bad:** In notifications, there is a list of notifications that have been sent by instructor to the class through CCLE. I have multiple messages but there is no back button. Three dots at the top do not have a back button. | **Improvement:** Place a back button option at the top in addition to the three dot icon.
**Consistency and standards:** Design and usage is consistent across all pages of the web/app. | **Bad:** Some drop down menus are not the same style: check in circle; smaller, dark circle in larger one; square vs circle. In each course there are options at the top for Contents, Grades, and Competencies. Competencies is empty and the meaning of it is unknown. | **Improvement:** Have a uniform drop down menu style and select option. Have a description on pages where there is no information or titles can be ambiguous. 
**Error prevention:** Provide safety nets for user, such as confirming an action. | **Good:** There is a save button for when submitting assignments. | **No Improvements:** There seem to be enough precautions in place that will prevent the user from making any detrimental actions that cannot be undone.
**Recognition rather than recall:** Provide suggestions or context in actions. | **Bad:** Search courses, doesnâ€™t search your courses but searches for other courses. | **Improvement:** Either describe what the search function is for or change the search function to be searching within your courses. 
**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Make a page that is accessible to all, have basic functions at the forefront and more advanced options accessible through more steps. |**Good:** General settings and then more advanced, less used ones separate, such as synching. **Bad:** Sometimes there is extra navigation involved that does not require it, there is only one option in each navigation step. | **Improvement:** Depending on how many options in each setting step, reduce the amount of steps to get to the end option.
**Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Design is not cluttered and easily accessible. | **Bad:** The large colored bars for each class at the home page are not needed. They clutter the page and make it so you have to scroll more. | **Improvement:** Take away the colored blocks and just have separate, distinct boxes for each course.
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Have a non-concerning message about an error and give information on how to fix it of move forward. | **Bad:** Error notifications have to be manually put on, through a 4 step process. | **Improvement:** Have error notifications be set automatically. The user can manually turn them off if that is their choice.
**Help and documentation:** Have easily accessible and understandable help pages or pages with commonly asked questions. | **Bad:** Help takes you to an outside page, out of the app. The help seems to be more catered to administrators, rather than users. No search for help. No FAQ, common issues. No Trouble shooting. Help does not reflect the app or how it looks. | **Improvement:** Have a help that is centered for users within the app and one that reflects the app that is in use. An FAQ of troubleshooting option in the app would also be helpful. 

#### Severity Rating 
1. Top Priority: Visibility of system status; Help and documentation
2. Important to Fix: Match between system and real world; User control and freedom; Recognition rather than recall; Flexibility and efficiency of use
3. Small Inconvenience: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors; Consistency and standards; Aesthetic and minimalist design


### National Weather Service
*The National Weather Service website works in conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They provide local and national weather forecasts along with detailed maps that contain other meteorological information on maps. They have past weather, safety, and educational material on their website.*

#### Evaluation 
*Overall: The National Weather Service website is not an easily navigable website. However, it is very easy to get lost in the web page. Since the website works with two corporations you never know where a link will take you. This does not make the user experience smooth or enjoyable. The designs change with almost every page change and those pages are also overwhelming with different information and designs. This website needs major improvements.*

Heuristic & Description | Weather.gov Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement 
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------
**Visibility of system status:** The web/app gives the user feedback in a timely manner concerning the actions they are currently doing. | **Bad:** The indication of what page I am looking at based on the top menu bar is not obvious. The small arrow sequence of page indication is hard to see. | **Improvement:** changing the color or the header of the page currently on would make it easier for users to navigate the pages and know what page they currently are one. 
**Match between system and real world:** Design and icons are based off of general knowledge. Things the user will easily recognize. | **Good:** there are maps that reflect the area where the weather forecast is being displayed and there are visual icons that match the weather. **Bad:** Many acronyms are used that can be confusing and not common language for people that are not savvy in weather forecasting or the website. | **Improvement:** Use language that everyone will understand and limit the use of acronyms.
**User control and freedom:** User has options, such as undo or redo. | **Bad:** There is no clear way to navigate back to a previous page, since clicking on a top tab option sometimes takes you to a completely different looking page. | **Improvement:** Have an organized way of navigating through the different clickable tabs/links on the page. Do not change the style of the page every time a different link is selected.
**Consistency and standards:** Design and usage is consistent across all pages of the web/app. | **Bad:** Switches between web styles. Menu bar is at the left sometimes and other times at the top.  | **Improvement:** Keep menus and orienting buttons in the same place, so the user will always know where to go when confused. 
**Error prevention:** Provide safety nets for user, such as confirming an action. | **Bad:** Because of the change in webpages with in the weather website there is no easily navigable way to get back to the home page if the user had gone to a page that no longer has the home tab. | **Improvement:** Have a website that is consistent in name and organization so that there is always an easy way to get back to the previous page or to go home.
**Recognition rather than recall:** Provide suggestions or context in actions. | **Good:** In the search bar it recommends the user to put in their, city, state, or zip code to find local weather | **No Improvement:** This is helpful because it tells the user what they should be searching for their and it offers a way to narrow their search from state, to city, to zip code to get a more accurate forecast. 
**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Make a page that is accessible to all, have basic functions at the forefront and more advanced options accessible through more steps. | **Bad:** The webpage has a lot of acronyms and weather watching options that are highly visible on the home page and may be confusing to some users. | **Improvement:** By hiding the advanced weather options from users who just want to see a simple forecast the experience will be easier to navigate and understand to those who do not have extensive knowledge in meteorology. It would be easier if most of the options were taken away.
**Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Design is not cluttered and easily accessible. | **Bad:** Web page styles change when different links are clicked. Pages are often times busy and have small and hard to read fonts. | **Improvement:** Create a streamlined webpage. One that does not change websites and keeps the same web theme throughout. This will help a lot of the issues. 
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Have a non-concerning message about an error and give information on how to fix it of move forward. | **Bad:** 404 error page was not easy to understand. | **Improvement:** Have an explanation of what went wrong and how to fix it. Many sites now have personalized 404 error pages that soften the error waring. This could be useful here.
**Help and documentation:** Have easily accessible and understandable help pages or pages with commonly asked questions. | **Good:** There is a contact us option in the about drop down that has an FAQ link and a help link. **Bad:** There is no option to give manual feedback. | **Improvement:** Make available an option to provide feedback on the website or to have more in depth questions than the ones in the FAQ listing.
