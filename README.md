## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
My project is meant to support users by allowing them to browse senior care websites with more ease and confidence. Because technology is oftentimes a challenge for the elderly, I hope my project will serve to improve the accessibility of senior care and help the eldery find what they are looking for efficiently. 
  
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity fulfills the userâ€™s basic need for safety because it allows users to connect with caregivers that will be able to support them in their old age. Users will be able to feel like their needs are being tended to and that they no longer have to worry about taking care of themselves.
  
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to satisfy the need for senior care are apps and websites that offer a database of senior caregivers users can reach out to and hire. These websites and apps oftentimes filter caregivers based on your needs and requirements, but they can sometimes be difficult or confusing to use.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The current limitations to finding senior care is not having a comprehensive databse of available caregivers in your area to look through. Because caregivers and seniors sign up to different websites and apps, there is a big possibility users are unable to complete list of caregivers they can hire, which can lead to potentially missing out on someone who is perfect for your needs.

## Step02: Target users 

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: elderly people looking for senior care, friends and family of seniors who want to find their loved ones proper care 
Preference: users who are genuinely interested in finding senior care and are ready to hire a caregiver
Expertise: users do not have to have previous experience or expertise to use this application

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users can look for senior care in person at care facilities or online through websites and apps. Users can filter through caregivers they are interested in and that fit their specifications to then hire them for work. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet or go to local care facilities to identify caregivers they want to take care of themselves or their loved ones. Users could also ask for recommendations from friends or family that they trust. 

## Step03: Pick research methods 
The observation method I chose was participatory observation. I had my participant engage in a few activites to see his reaction and his experience with senior care websites. Ideally, my participant would have been an elderly person. Unfortunately, my elderly family members do not speak English and due to the pandemic, I thought it would be best to not reach out to random participants on the street.

## Insights from the Interview 
### What do you like and dislike about the current ways that you are able to find senior care? 
2:51 

it's just good that there's a lot of options and there's a lot of ease of access, especially now with how the internet works. It's really easy to findresources. And then dislike, I guess not really anything. It's just hard to find good option because of how much choice you're given.

### how much time would you ideally like to spend on looking for a caregiver?
5:56 

I would definitely want to be careful. I don't know. I guess it's hard to gauge maybe a few hours, just to make sure that I'm, I know specifically who I want, and have some time to talk to them and get to know that they're the best they'd be compatible with, with the needs of the person that needs care.

### What is the most difficult part about finding a senior caregiver and your experience and then on the website in general?
9:35  

Just my experience, I guess, the wide range of options just makes it hard to really boil it down to like a few options to choose from. It's just, I guess, when you have so many options, it just becomes inherently difficult to find what you what you think is the best option. And obviously, everyone wants the best option for themselves, so choosing can be difficult.


### What are some limitations of the website that you noticed? 
10:34  

The interface, the graphic interface design was just a bit outdated. And then maybe for for people who are seeking care for themselves, or people who don't have that much experience with the internet might find it a bit more difficult to navigate.

11:06

Some of the text is a bit small, and the front page doesn't make it that easy to find specifically what you're looking for. It just feels a bit disorganized. 




## Reflection 

I thought it was very interesting and helpful to interview someone and guage how they would approach looking for a senior caregiver through observation and asking them questions about their thoughts and opinions. An interesting point the participant brought up was how having too many options for caregivers was overwhelming and made it difficult to narrow down. I originally thought the more options the better because the user would be able to really pick and choose, but it was good to interview someone to help me see a different perspective. Unfortunately, I had to conduct the interview over Zoom due to the pandemic and I was unable to find someone elderly to interview, but I thought the interview still went smoothly with my participant. The participant expressed concerns about difficulties seniors might experience while navigating the site so next time, I would try to find a senior participant to see how they do with the same tasks and questions. I also found it difficult to come up with good questions for my script because I found myself repeating similar questions or coming up with questions with no real value, so it took me a while to write the script. Overall, this experience helped me overcome some personal biases I had regarding senior care websites and I look forward to using the information I gathered to improve my own project.
