### User testing
GoNannies.com is a website for seniors to find caregivers to help them in their old age. Users are able to filter and sort caregivers based on location, age, living arrangement, availability, language, experience, and more. Users are then able to contact the nannies for employment or add them to a watchlist for future reference. 

We will be performing a usability test for GoNannies.com to evaluate how effective and efficient the site is to navigate and complete tasks with. Through this test, we will be able to identify any flaws in usability to see what works well with the site and what is ineffective. The purpose of the test is to find out how to improve the website from the perspective of the user. The usability test will be recorded for behavioral analysis. In the test, users were asked to complete three tasks which included 1) finding information about background checks, 2) finding a caregiver that matches a specific set of requirements, and 3) finding information regarding interview questions.

In the heuristic analysis I conducted on GoNannies.com, I found several usability issues. The first one was the overall aesthetic of the website. I found the website to be messy and cluttered, which may pose threats for seniors who are unfamiliar with technology. The font is also very small and sometimes the color of the words do not contrast the background enough. The second one was a lack of user control and freedom. There are no options for undo or redo buttons, and oftentimes no error prevention measures for submitting forms. Lastly, there is barely any communication with users about the status of the system and it is difficult for users to guage where they are and how the system is functioning.

I performed my usability test on my laptop in my apartment. I used ActivePresenter to record the test, which records the screen, audio, the participant, and myself. This is a pilot test to test the setting and the materials.

The usability test begings with an introduction to explain to the participant the website they are testing and some basic information about the session. After, the user will give informed consent and agree with the terms. The user then answers background questions and pre-test questions. Next, the user will navigate the site to complete 3 tasks while thinking outloud to show their thought process. A post test questionnaire is taken after the tasks, with all the questions answered on a likert scale. The user then completes the SUS questionnaire and selects 5 adjectives from the product satisfaction card. Finally, demographic data is collected confidentially from the user.

## Improving user testing
During the pilot test, I learned what usability issues existed for Yelp. For example, I saw that it was not very intuitive for users to filter locations by hours of operation. I also learned that some of Yelp's capabilities, like collections, are incredibly difficult to find. What went well was that there was a mutual trust between the participant and moderator. The testing environment was also quiet. What did not go well was that I was unsure what to do when the user could not complete a certain task and that the internet connection was slow. In future usability tests, I will be more encouraging to the participant and ask them to speak out loud mo I would also perform the usability test in a more test-like environment rather than my dre.orm room. The pilot test was able to show me how users navigate the site and learn what parts of the site pose as usability errors.
