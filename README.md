## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is important because it helps us visualize and understand our target audience better through the creation of personas and situations. By analyzing the things members of our target audience say, think, do, and feel, we can view our product from the eyes of a user to tailor the product to improve overall user experience. UX storytelling offers a much more comprehensive outlook on the users themselves and help us shed our biases, which allows us to create the best product we can.

## Scenerios and Jounrey Maps
### Austin's Scenario
• Austin Chen is a second-year undergraduate student at UCLA. He still lives on The Hill (the dorms) and is a Computer Science and Statistics double major, meaning he has double the amount of work to study. Before college, he used to play sports, but after picking up an additional major, he has to spend most of his day and free time studying for his exam or working on an assignment. He never has time to go to the gym. However, he still wants to keep active during his study breaks and is looking to purchase exercise equipment to use in his dorm room. Since he does not have enough free time to leave campus to uber to the nearest sports store, which is a 50 min. drive away, and he also does not want to carry any heavy equipment to his dorm, he decides to shop online. Austin does not have a specific sports equipment he has in mind, but he hopes to find something quick so he can get back to studying.

• Austin opens up Amazon in a new tab during his short study break. He types "exercise equipment" in the search bar at the top of the main page and presses the button with the magnifying glass icon to search for results. The page refreshes to show a grid of categories that have grouped the results, such as "hand-weights," "stretching equipment,""exercise machines,""cardio,""lower-body strength," "upper-body strength", and "core strength." Below the grid of categories is a list of all potential "exercise equipment" results. Austin feels satisfied when he sees the categories because he can now choose what kind of equipment he wants to purchase. After reading the list of categories, Austin determines that he wants to improve his core muscles and clicks the box around "core strength" which leads him into a page with all of the results for exercise equipment relating to strengthening the core. Austin is instrigued with the diverse set of results because he did not know that some of these equipments existed. He finds the product he wants to purchase, he clicks the item's picture and he clicks the button "Add to Cart" to purchase the item. Austin returns back to his Statistics homework feeling excited about his new equipment arriving in the mail and pleased that he was able to decide what kind of equipment he wanted and purchase the product very quickly.

### Chelsea Smith's Scenerio
• Chelsea is a young, stay-at-home mother of 3 children, all under the age of 10 years old. When she is not picking or dropping them off at school/daycare/soccer practice, cooking dinner, cleaning the house, or supervising them, Chelsea is updated her popular mommy blog where she posts about her family, advice on how to balance life with three young kids, and fun events. She is planning on posting a blog post about her friend's upcoming baby shower. Her friend is having a girl and the baby shower will have a pink theme. Since Chelsea wants to take lots of pictures at the baby shower for her blog, she wants to buy a new pink dress in her size (size 6) that costs under $50 so she will look presentable in her photos. Unfortunately, she has no time to go to the mall over the next couple of weeks because she needs to take care of her kids who are home for the summer. Chelsea decides to look for her dress online so that she can shop while also keeping an eye on her kids.

• Chelsea finds a few minutes to open her laptop and sit at the dining room table. She goes onto Amazon and types "dress" in the search bar at the top of the main page and presses the button with the magnifying glass icon to search for results. The page shows a list of dresses, but Chelsea directs her attention to the left-side column of the website where the filters are located. Chelsea is able to view all the filters such as "color,""price,""reviews,""style," and "size." She is pleased that she can see all of the filters at once so she knows what she can adjust. All of the specific features for each filter type is hidden until Chelsea clicks the downward-arrow icon next to the title of the filter she wants to adjust. Since Chelsea is looking for a size 6, pink dress under $50, she clicks the downward-arrow for "size," and clicks the button labeled "6," then clicks the arrow for "color" and selects the pink rectangle, and clicks the arrow next to "price", types in "$0" in the "Min" text box and "$50" in the "Max" text box. Once she has finished adjusting all of her filters, she presses the button labeled "Go" at the bottom of all the filters. The page refreshes and shows dress results that fit Chelsea's filter adjustments. Chelsea feels like she has saved a lot of time because she was able to adjust three different filters and did not have to wait for the entire website to refresh between each adjustment. Chelsea quickly browses thtough the selection of dresses until she finds a dress she likes, knowing that it will be available in her size and fit her price range. She clicks the item's picture and clicks the button labeled "Add to Cart" to purchase the item. Chelsea closes her laptop and goes to the living room to keep an eye on her kids, feeling excited about her new dress and pleased that she was able to narrow down her choices and find a dress specified to her liking so quick and efficienty.
