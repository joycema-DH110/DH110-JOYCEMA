# Caregiver App for Senior Citizens
## Joyce Ma

### Introduction

This quarter, I centered my project around designing a senior caregiver app for senior citizens. In a world where technology is constantly advancing, it is important to provide senior citizens with platforms that are simple to use, yet up to date with current technology to help them complete necessary tasks. For my project, I created a new app for the elderly to find suitable caregivers near them that is clean, welcoming, and efficient. The app allows users to complete tasks such as filter caregivers based on requirements, run background checks, and contact potential caregivers. A common flaw the current popular senior caregiver websites and apps share is a cluttered interface that is difficult and confusing to use, so my app aims to simplify and streamline the process of finding a good caregiver for senior citizens.

### Design Statement

For the design of my project, I wanted to focus on creating an interface that is easy for seniors to navigate. The overall design of the app is straightforward and uncluttered, so seniors do not feel overwhelmed when browsing. The two main tasks I wanted to target with my design were creating a specialized filter to help narrow down caregiver options and organizing caregiver profiles to make background information more accessible. 

### Competitor Analysis

The two websites I chose to analyze were displayed on the first page of Google search results, because seniors searching up how to use technology are most likely to click on the first few links they see. As a result, I view these sites as my greatest competitors. The Join Papa site, though it is the first option to click, needs major improvements to successfully teach seniors how to use technology because it lacks important information. The Easy Tech Seniors site, though better than the Join Papa site, could also benefit from formatting changes. Because the Join Papa website addresses so many issues at once, their pages do not talk about the topics comprehensively. On the How to Teach Technoogy to Seniors page, the main issues is the lack of useful information. The information provided is extremely basic and vague, and would not be a good source to turn to for seniors inexperienced with technology.

### User Research

My project is meant to support users by allowing them to browse senior care websites with more ease and confidence. Because technology is oftentimes a challenge for the elderly, I hope my project will serve to improve the accessibility of senior care and help the eldery find what they are looking for efficiently. The current limitations to finding senior care is not having a comprehensive databse of available caregivers in your area to look through. Because caregivers and seniors sign up to different websites and apps, there is a big possibility users are unable to complete list of caregivers they can hire, which can lead to potentially missing out on someone who is perfect for your needs.

**Demographic:** elderly people looking for senior care, friends and family of seniors who want to find their loved ones proper care

**Preference:** users who are genuinely interested in finding senior care and are ready to hire a caregiver

**Expertise:** users do not have to have previous experience or expertise to use this application

The observation method I chose was participatory observation. I had my participant engage in a few activites to see his reaction and his experience with senior care websites. Ideally, my participant would have been an elderly person. Unfortunately, my elderly family members do not speak English and due to the pandemic, I thought it would be best to not reach out to random participants on the street. I thought it was very interesting and helpful to interview someone and guage how they would approach looking for a senior caregiver through observation and asking them questions about their thoughts and opinions. Overall, this experience helped me overcome some personal biases I had regarding senior care websites and I look forward to using the information I gathered to improve my own project.

### UX Storytelling

UX storytelling is important because it helps us visualize and understand our target audience better through the creation of personas and situations. By analyzing the things members of our target audience say, think, do, and feel, we can view our product from the eyes of a user to tailor the product to improve overall user experience. UX storytelling offers a much more comprehensive outlook on the users themselves and help us shed our biases, which allows us to create the best product we can.

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation

![Variations](https://github.com/joycema-DH110/DH110-JOYCEMA/blob/main/Variations.jpg)

The three distinct templates I created for the screen design were the Log In page, the Create an Account page, and the Find a Senior Caregiver page. These screens have graphic design components such as a consistent color scheme, recognizable icons, input boxes, buttons, and drop down menus. I created 3 different variations of the Create an Account screen, including a light mode, dark mode, and in between mode.

For my app, I wanted to make it simple and accessible for seniors to use. After conducting some research on appropriate color schemes, I found that seniors have difficulty differentiating between blues and greens and respond better to warm colors, such as orange and red. As a result, I decided to choose a warm color scheme with mainly orange tones to make it easier for seniors to view the app. I also wanted to keep the interface minimal and not cluttered so users would not be distracted or confused trying to find the next step.

### Low Fidelity Prototype

The purpose of the low fidelity prototype is to create a general layout of how my platform will look and function. By mapping out the general flow of the screens, I will be able to gain a better understanding of how everything will look in the end and where the problem areas are. By testing the low fidelity prototype, I can see which features are actually functionable and useful and which are confusing and unnecessary. The test will allow me to see my product through the eyes of the user to gain important insight which can be applied to improve user experience. My prototype will go through two tasks that target two problems I noticed in the design of other senior care sites.

The user did not exhibit confusion while going through the wireframes and was able to follow along with the wireflows and different screens. The reason I kept my flow simple was because my platform is tailored towards senior citizens, many of whom are unfamiliar with technology and would do better with simple processes. I believe by getting rid of excess options and having the user go through the necessary steps in an orderly and simple manner, possible confusion and frustration can be reduced ahead of time.

### Conclusion

Throughout this whole process, I gained valuable experience with UX/UI design that I did not have previously. I learned how to do the demographic research behind creating a website or app, run tests with participants, draw up wireframes and wireflows, and eventually create a high fidelity prototype of my app. I learned how our internal biases can affect the way we view and use our own apps and websites and how important it is to incorporate the suggestions of participants to improve the user experience. I also learned how intentional design should be and things such as font contrast and size need to be tested in order to make sure the platform is accessible to everyone. 

If I could redo aspects of this project, I would try to find participants in my actual target demographic, which is senior citizens, to run my participant tests. Because of the constraints I faced this quarter I was only able to find peers to evaluate my app, but I know the feedback would have been more relevant from someone who would actually be using the app. Regardless, my peers still offered helpful suggestions to help me improve my prototypes. 

Overall, I felt I learned a lot about UX/UI design this quarter and I feel much more comfortable using platforms such as Github and Figma to complete my work. I am happy I was able to create the prototype of an app that successfully completes the goal I set out to complete: helping senior citizens find a suitable caregiver.
