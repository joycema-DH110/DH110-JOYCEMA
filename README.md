# Teaching Technology to Seniors  
## Joyce Ma - Digital Humanities 110

For my project, I am focusing on teaching the elderly how to use technology, because it is an important skill to have in a world where technology is constantly evolving. The two websites I chose to analyze were displayed on the first page of Google search results, because seniors searching up how to use technology are most likely to click on the first few links they see. As a result, I view these sites as my greatest competitors. The Join Papa site, though it is the first option to click, needs major improvements to successfully teach seniors how to use technology because it lacks important information. The Easy Tech Seniors site, though better than the Join Papa site, could also benefit from formatting changes.

### Join Papa 
*Join Papa is a website for seniors to find younger mentors to teach them things such as how to use technology. It offers other services to seniors as well, such as companionship, help with chores, running errands, and more. Seniors can use this site to book Caregivers to address their needs.*

#### Evaluation
*Overall: Because the Join Papa website addresses so many issues at once, their pages do not talk about the topics comprehensively. On the How to Teach Technoogy to Seniors page, the main issues is the lack of useful information. The information provided is extremely basic and vague, and would not be a good source to turn to for seniors inexperienced with technology.*

Heuristic & Description | Join Papa Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement 
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------

Options are highlighted when you hover over them to show you can click them. **Bad:** No other indication of which page you are if you scroll down. | **Improvement:** Allow a scroll to top button for viewers to quickly see the header again, because that is the only way to see where you are.
**Match between system and real world:** The jargon, photos, and icons are easily recognizable and are not difficult to understand. | **Good:** Everything is easily unerstandable and does not require background knowledge to understand. **Bad:** Lack of icons on the page. | **Improvement:** The website could benefit from more recognizable icons to direct people, because it lacks visually appealing aspects.

#### Evaluation 
*Overall: Easy Tech Seniors provides a lot of information and tips on how to teach technology to seniors, but the overload of information may be overwhelming and difficult to digest. It could be beneficial to break up some of the pages into smaller sections to make it cleaner. The website needs to be improved, but it is better than the Join Papa site.*

Heuristic & Description | Easy Tech Seniors Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement 
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------
**Visibility of system status:** The website includes things such as headers and titles that show users where they are on the page. | **Bad:** The indication of what page I am looking at based on the top menu bar is not obvious. The small arrow sequence of page indication is hard to see. | **Improvement:** changing the color or the header of the page currently on would make it easier for users to navigate the pages and know what page they currently are one. 
**Match between system and real world:** he jargon, photos, and icons are easily recognizable and are not difficult to understand. | **Good:** there are maps that reflect the area where the weather forecast is being displayed and there are visual icons that match the weather. **Bad:** Many acronyms are used that can be confusing and not common language for people that are not savvy in weather forecasting or the website. | **Improvement:** Use language that everyone will understand and limit the use of acronyms.
**User control and freedom:** User has options to exit, undo, redo, or go back so they are not trapped. | **Bad:** There is no clear way to navigate back to a previous page, since clicking on a top tab option sometimes takes you to a completely different looking page. | **Improvement:** Have an organized way of navigating through the different clickable tabs/links on the page. Do not change the style of the page every time a different link is selected.
**Consistency and standards:** Design is consistent throughout the website. | **Bad:** Switches between web styles. Menu bar is at the left sometimes and other times at the top.  | **Improvement:** Keep menus and orienting buttons in the same place, so the user will always know where to go when confused. 
**Error prevention:** Allows viewers to catch their mistakes if they accidentally click something. | **Bad:** Because of the change in webpages with in the weather website there is no easily navigable way to get back to the home page if the user had gone to a page that no longer has the home tab. | **Improvement:** Have a website that is consistent in name and organization so that there is always an easy way to get back to the previous page or to go home.
**Recognition rather than recall:** Make the site easy to navigate by having options visible, so users do not have to remember how to navigate the site. | **Good:** In the search bar it recommends the user to put in their, city, state, or zip code to find local weather | **No Improvement:** This is helpful because it tells the user what they should be searching for their and it offers a way to narrow their search from state, to city, to zip code to get a more accurate forecast. 
**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Cater a website to the user through shortcuts that can be beneficial to both experienced and inexperienced users. | **Bad:** The webpage has a lot of acronyms and weather watching options that are highly visible on the home page and may be confusing to some users. | **Improvement:** By hiding the advanced weather options from users who just want to see a simple forecast the experience will be easier to navigate and understand to those who do not have extensive knowledge in meteorology. It would be easier if most of the options were taken away.
**Aesthetic and minimalist design:** The design is easy to digest and understand. | **Bad:** Web page styles change when different links are clicked. Pages are often times busy and have small and hard to read fonts. | **Improvement:** Create a streamlined webpage. One that does not change websites and keeps the same web theme throughout. This will help a lot of the issues. 
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Website alerts users of any errors in simple language with a solution. | **Bad:** 404 error page was not easy to understand. | **Improvement:** Have an explanation of what went wrong and how to fix it. Many sites now have personalized 404 error pages that soften the error waring. This could be useful here.
**Help and documentation:** Have an option for users to reach out or search for more information if they have questions. | **Good:** There is a contact us option in the about drop down that has an FAQ link and a help link. **Bad:** There is no option to give manual feedback. | **Improvement:** Make available an option to provide feedback on the website or to have more in depth questions than the ones in the FAQ listing.
