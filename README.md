### User testing
GoNannies.com is a website for seniors to find caregivers to help them in their old age. Users are able to filter and sort caregivers based on location, age, living arrangement, availability, language, experience, and more. Users are then able to contact the nannies for employment or add them to a watchlist for future reference. 

We will be performing a usability test for GoNannies.com to evaluate how effective and efficient the site is to navigate and complete tasks with. Through this test, we will be able to identify any flaws in usability to see what works well with the site and what is ineffective. The purpose of the test is to find out how to improve the website from the perspective of the user. The usability test will be recorded for behavioral analysis. In the test, users were asked to complete three tasks which included 1) finding information about background checks, 2) finding a caregiver that matches a specific set of requirements, and 3) finding information regarding interview questions.

In the heuristic analysis I conducted on GoNannies.com, I found several usability issues. The first one was the overall aesthetic of the website. I found the website to be messy and cluttered, which may pose threats for seniors who are unfamiliar with technology. The font is also very small and sometimes the color of the words do not contrast the background enough. The second one was a lack of user control and freedom. There are no options for undo or redo buttons, and oftentimes no error prevention measures for submitting forms. Lastly, there is barely any communication with users about the status of the system and it is difficult for users to guage where they are and how the system is functioning.

I performed my usability test on my laptop in my apartment. I used ActivePresenter to record the test, which records the screen, audio, the participant, and myself. This is a pilot test to test the setting and the materials.

The usability test begings with an introduction to explain to the participant the website they are testing and some basic information about the session. After, the user will give informed consent and agree with the terms. The user then answers background questions and pre-test questions. Next, the user will navigate the site to complete 3 tasks while thinking outloud to show their thought process. A post test questionnaire is taken after the tasks, with all the questions answered on a likert scale. The user then completes the SUS questionnaire and selects 5 adjectives from the product satisfaction card. Finally, demographic data is collected confidentially from the user.

## Reflection
During the pilot test, I gained more insight about the issues GoNannies.com faces in terms of usability. I noticed that because the site was so cluttered and distracting, my participant sometimes had trouble completing the tasks quickly and efficiently because he had to spend time looking through everything. The formatting and aesthetic of the site also changed when you clicked on a link to go to a new page, which could be seen as confusing and forces the user to relearn how to use the site every time they leave the page. Overall, the website can be cleaned up and organized better to make it easier for seniors to access, especially if they are unfamiliar with technology.

What went well was the participant was able to successfully complete all parts of all 3 tasks. The test ran smoothly and the participant was able to understand and answer all of the questions without supplmental questions about the material. The recording software also worked well and allowed me to capture the video, audio, and screenrecording. The environment was clean and quiet, which allowed for a good video to hear and see the participant's reactions. What did not go as well was the fact that I found it difficult to keep a straight face and remain unbiased sometimes during the test. I also should have prompted the participant to speak more about what he thought about the site and asked questions to get his opinions. In the future, I will
