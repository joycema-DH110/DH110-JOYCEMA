# Teaching Technology to Seniors  
## Joyce Ma - Digital Humanities 110

For my project, I am focusing on teaching the elderly how to use technology, because it is an important skill to have in a world where technology is constantly evolving. The two websites I chose to analyze were displayed on the first page of Google search results, because seniors searching up how to use technology are most likely to click on the first few links they see. As a result, I view these sites as my greatest competitors. The Join Papa site, though it is the first option to click, needs major improvements to successfully teach seniors how to use technology because it lacks important information. The Easy Tech Seniors site, though better than the Join Papa site, could also benefit from formatting changes.

### Join Papa 
*Join Papa is a website for seniors to find younger mentors to teach them things such as how to use technology. It offers other services to seniors as well, such as companionship, help with chores, running errands, and more. Seniors can use this site to book Caregivers to address their needs.*

#### Evaluation
*Overall: Because the Join Papa website addresses so many issues at once, their pages do not talk about the topics comprehensively. On the How to Teach Technoogy to Seniors page, the main issues is the lack of useful information. The information provided is extremely basic and vague, and would not be a good source to turn to for seniors inexperienced with technology.*

#### Evaluation 
*Overall: Easy Tech Seniors provides a lot of information and tips on how to teach technology to seniors, but the overload of information may be overwhelming and difficult to digest. It could be beneficial to break up some of the pages into smaller sections to make it cleaner. The website needs to be improved, but it is better than the Join Papa site.*
