# DH110 Assignment 6: High-Fidelity Prototype (Part One:Yellow)

## Joyce Ma 

## Overview

**Description of Project:** My project centers around providing seniors an accessible app to use when looking for senior care. Because many eldery people find it difficult to navigate technology, my goal is to design an app with an appropriate color scheme, font, and flow to increase usability and allow elderly people to find what they are looking for with ease. 

**Purpose of Prototyping:** The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to map out a detailed version of the app design to test any flaws in usability. The prototype will allow us to see if certain tasks are easily completable and what needs to be changed to allow for a better user experience.

**Process of Prototyping:** The high fidelity prototype was created on Figma, a web-based prototyping tool. On Figma, I turned the low fidelity prototypes into high fidelity prototypes by implementing actual usable features and creating a consistent design theme throughout the wireframes. The general aesthetic was designed with seniors in mind and the tasks chosen were tasks that will be commonly completed within the app when it is ready to use.

## Tasks

**Task 1: Using a specialized filter to help narrow down caregiver options**
>In this task, Betty (the associated user persona) opens the senior care app and logs in. She is then directed to the Find a Senior Caregiver page, where she is prompted to input her state and zip code. After, she can choose her desired filters such as distance, age range, living arrangement, availability, etc. to find her perfect care giver. She then presses Next and is routed to the page of available caregivers, which she can scroll through to find someone she likes. She presses View Profile on a caregiver to see her profile and presses Contact. Betty writes a message and presses Submit. 

**Task 2: Organizing caregiver profiles to make background information more accessible**
>In this task, Elijah (the associated user persona) opens the senior care app and logs in. He has already inputted his desired filters so he is automatically redirected to the available caregivers page, where he was last. He finds a caregiver he likes and clicks View Profile and is redirected to the caregivers profile. Elijah then scrolls down to the Background Information section of the profile and has the options to click Background Check, References, or Qualifications. Each link takes Elijah to a different screen where he can see the respective information.

### Graphical Interface Design Explanation
The base of the interface of this prototype comes directly from the existing application, ParkMobile. As a result, I primarily built on the app's existing color scheme to choose the colors for the additional elements I added into the design. In the first two interactions, the colors I utilized were primarily green, white, and black. Because I also used screenshots of the Google Maps interface in the third interaction, another color I added was the blue color native to Google Maps. The elements I added into the existing interface in order to create this prototype include buttons, notifications, bubbles with the dollar amount for parking, and the ParkMobile logo. All of these added elements are mostly rounded in shape in order to best align with the existing elements in the ParkMobile and Google Maps interfaces.

I did try to test my prototype for color accessibility, but because I was utilizing screenshots of ParkMobile and Google Maps rather than completely re-designing the interface, the test was not applicable. However, because I primarily used the same colors and forms as those already used in ParkMobile and Google Maps, my prototype is likely to have a decently high level of accessibility.
