## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
My project is meant to support users by allowing them to browse senior care websites with more ease and confidence. Because technology is oftentimes a challenge for the elderly, I hope my project will serve to improve the accessibility of senior care and help the eldery find what they are looking for efficiently. 
  
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety because it allows users to connect with caregivers that will be able to support them in their old age. Users will be able to feel like their needs are being tended to and that they no longer have to worry about taking care of themselves.
  
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to satisfy the need for senior care are apps and websites that offer a database of senior caregivers users can reach out to and hire. These websites and apps oftentimes filter caregivers based on your needs and requirements, but they can sometimes be difficult or confusing to use.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The current limitations to finding senior care is not having a comprehensive databse of available caregivers in your area to look through. Because caregivers and seniors sign up to different websites and apps, there is a big possibility users are unable to complete list of caregivers they can hire, which can lead to potentially missing out on someone who is perfect for your needs.

## Step02: Target users 

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: elderly people looking for senior care, friends and family of seniors who want to find their loved ones proper care 
Preference: users who are genuinely interested in finding senior care and are ready to hire a caregiver
Expertise: users do not have to have previous experience or expertise to use this application

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users can look for senior care in person at care facilities or online through websites and apps. Users can filter through caregivers they are interested in and that fit their specifications to then hire them for work. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet or go to local care facilities to identify caregivers they want to take care of themselves or their loved ones. Users could also ask for recommendations from friends or family that they trust. 

## Step03: Pick research methods 
The observation method I chose was participatory observation. I had my participant engage in a few activites to see his reaction and his experience with senior care websites. Ideally, my participant would have been an elderly person. Unfortunately, my elderly family members do not speak English and due to the pandemic, I thought it would be best to not reach out to random participants on the street.

## Insights from the Interview 
### How important is it to you to volunteer in a group? 
Part 1 // 11:00 

I definitely think that [volunteering with] a group makes me feel like I'm a part of something. And it kind of shows that like it's not just me caring about it, there are multiple people that care, and that we want to show that, hey, there is already there's this family or this group that wants to make a change, and we want you to join that change. So I definitely think that having a group organization is definitely almost vital to for social change.

### What do you think are some potential pros to volunteering with a small organization versus a larger organization? 
Part 1 // 14:29 

I definitely think that when you're volunteering with a smaller organization, you definitely have more of a sense of community within your organization, and you can kind of get to know how the organization is really making a difference on a more personal level. So I definitely think that that's a pro but I also think that with a smaller organization, you likely won't be able to make as much change as you would like, as if you were to have a larger organization where you trade off something personal experience and that personal connection to the organization for the chance that having a greater impact

### What are your thoughts after reading the client story? How did it make you feel? 
Part 2 // 12:40  

I initially chose it because I know that China has very heavy censorship, and they have denied that Tianmen happened. So that just hearing of what happened Tianmen square back in the late 80s iinitially drew me in. Reading Mr. Wu’s story definitely made me angry because he would face imprisonment if you were to go back. But I'm also somewhat angry because even though he's gone through this process for years at this point, and he's just worked very hard with multiple attorneys through his organization, he still wasn't granted asylum. That made me angry at how inefficient the immigration process is in America. And it kind of ended on a sad note that
he wasn't able to reunite with his family. That kind of made me feel like I need to help. It somewhat humanized Mr. W to where I feel a need to help people such as Mr. Wu who are affected by this crisis.


### [After completing activities] Does reading more about the stories affect how connected you feel to the issue? 
Part 3 // 1:04  

I definitely think that by having the names of lawyers creates that personal connection between you, the reader and the organization themselves, and helps show that it's not just like this big corporation, but rather, it's people working usually long hours, so that they can make a difference in the world. And it kind of makes me feel like I am somewhat obliged to do like to support them.
