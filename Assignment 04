## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is important because it helps us visualize and understand our target audience better through the creation of personas and situations. By analyzing the things members of our target audience say, think, do, and feel, we can view our product from the eyes of a user to tailor the product to improve overall user experience. UX storytelling offers a much more comprehensive outlook on the users themselves and help us shed our biases, which allows us to create the best product we can.

## Scenerios and Journey Maps
### Betty's Scenario
• Betty is an 81 year old senior whose husband recently passed away, leaving her without close family to take care of her in her old age. Her and her husband never had children, so she had always relied on her husband to help her remember her medications and help her around the house. Betty spends her free time catching up on television shows and knitting sweaters, but she cannot help but feel lonely and helpless. On top of everything, she is unfamiliar with technology and has trouble browsing the Internet for senior care. Betty is in the market for a senior caregiver who is willing to move in with her to provide her with companionship and assistance in her old age. 

• After a long day of knitting, Betty tries going on the Internet again to look through some senior care websites to hopefully find a good caregiver for her to hire. After Googling "senior caregivers near me," she settles on GoNannies.com to continue her search. As she scrolls through the website, she finds herself scrolling through columns of caregiver profiles that do not fit exactly what she is looking for. She knows she wants a live in, female, non-smoking caregiver who speaks English and has a valid Driver's License, but Betty notices how tedious it is to scroll through so many profiles that do not match. Betty starts to worry as she smells her casserole burning in the oven and knows she has to hurry up her search. Fortunately, she finds a filtering option in a dropdown menu that allows her to tailor her requirements exactly to her liking. She clicks all the boxes that are important to her and presses search. 10 profiles pop up instead of the original 50, and Betty feels much better finding a more narrow list of applicants. She goes to save her casserole and returns to slowly leaf through the remaining profiles.

### Chelsea Smith's Scenerio
• Elijah is an 83 year old senior who has 2 children and is currently living with his wife. He was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which has put a strain on him and his wife's life. Elijah lives a pleasant life with his wife, but he does not want to place the burden of taking care of him as his Alzheimer's worsens completely on his wife. Because they are both not well versed with technology, they usually turn to the help of their children to help them navigate websites, but their children are oftentimes busy with work or their own families. Elijah is looking for a caregiver who specializes in Alzheimer's disease to make sure he receives the best care he can find for his situation so him and his wife no longer have to worry.

• Elijah and his wife finish up with dinner and decide to go on their desktop computer to continue looking for senior caregivers in their area. Elijah looks through multiple websites but feels unsatisfied with the provided background information of each of the profiles he clicks on. Because he is looking for a specific type of caregiver and needs to trust his caregiver is qualified to help him as his memory deteriorates, he wants to read through references, examine experience, and run a background check on everyone he is interested in. Frustrated, he keeps clicking through profiles until he notices he can open and expand each caregiver's profile to reveal all of their credentials in the same location. Here, he can find information on years of experience, specializations, criminal record, references to contact, and everthing else Elijah needs to feel confident he picked the right caregiver.
