# DH 110: Assignment 3 
## Introductory Steps 

## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
My project is meant to support users by allowing them to browse senior care websites with more ease and confidence. Because technology is oftentimes a challenge for the elderly, I hope my project will serve to improve the accessibility of senior care and help the eldery find what they are looking for efficiently. 
  
### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety because it allows users to connect with caregivers that will be able to support them in their old age. Users will be able to feel like their needs are being tended to and that they no longer have to worry about taking care of themselves.
  
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solutions to satisfy the need for senior care are apps and websites that offer a database of senior caregivers users can reach out to and hire. These websites and apps oftentimes filter caregivers based on your needs and requirements, but they can sometimes be difficult or confusing to use.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The current limitations to finding senior care is not having a comprehensive databse of available caregivers in your area to look through. Because caregivers and seniors sign up to different websites and apps, there is a big possibility users are unable to complete list of caregivers they can hire, which can lead to potentially missing out on someone who is perfect for your needs.

## Step02: Target users 

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: people interested in social causes, potentially more socially aware with refugee and asylum seeking topics 
Preference: users prefer spending their time helping their community, interested in engaging with human rights 
Expertise: no expertise is necessarily required to get started 

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
There are several ways users can engage with nonprofit organizations such as The Advocates for Human Rights. Although a lot of the volunteering is done local to the nonprofit, there are online resources to expand one’s knowledge and reach regarding asylum seekers and refugees. Users would most likely engage with the website from their home, not necessarily interacting with anyone. This is why an appropriately engaging design is crucial to retaining volunteers. In terms of the actual goal of the nonprofit, there are local events as well as a variety of resources and events that are more central to the legal system so volunteers can engage wherever they may be in the United States. There are varying places users would do the activity whether that is defined as engaging with the website or volunteerism. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would search the internet for nonprofit organizations about refugee or asylum seekers if they were looking for these types of organizations. For opportunities within the Advocates for Human Rights, they would search the volunteer tab and look through opportunities there to engage with their organization and events. 

## Step03: Pick research methods 
The observation method I employed was participatory observation. I had several activities with my interviewee to explore the social issue and his potential interest as well as his reaction to the topic.

## Insights from the Interview 
### How important is it to you to volunteer in a group? 
Part 1 // 11:00 

I definitely think that [volunteering with] a group makes me feel like I'm a part of something. And it kind of shows that like it's not just me caring about it, there are multiple people that care, and that we want to show that, hey, there is already there's this family or this group that wants to make a change, and we want you to join that change. So I definitely think that having a group organization is definitely almost vital to for social change.

### What do you think are some potential pros to volunteering with a small organization versus a larger organization? 
Part 1 // 14:29 

I definitely think that when you're volunteering with a smaller organization, you definitely have more of a sense of community within your organization, and you can kind of get to know how the organization is really making a difference on a more personal level. So I definitely think that that's a pro but I also think that with a smaller organization, you likely won't be able to make as much change as you would like, as if you were to have a larger organization where you trade off something personal experience and that personal connection to the organization for the chance that having a greater impact

### What are your thoughts after reading the client story? How did it make you feel? 
Part 2 // 12:40  

I initially chose it because I know that China has very heavy censorship, and they have denied that Tianmen happened. So that just hearing of what happened Tianmen square back in the late 80s iinitially drew me in. Reading Mr. Wu’s story definitely made me angry because he would face imprisonment if you were to go back. But I'm also somewhat angry because even though he's gone through this process for years at this point, and he's just worked very hard with multiple attorneys through his organization, he still wasn't granted asylum. That made me angry at how inefficient the immigration process is in America. And it kind of ended on a sad note that
he wasn't able to reunite with his family. That kind of made me feel like I need to help. It somewhat humanized Mr. W to where I feel a need to help people such as Mr. Wu who are affected by this crisis.


### [After completing activities] Does reading more about the stories affect how connected you feel to the issue? 
Part 3 // 1:04  

I definitely think that by having the names of lawyers creates that personal connection between you, the reader and the organization themselves, and helps show that it's not just like this big corporation, but rather, it's people working usually long hours, so that they can make a difference in the world. And it kind of makes me feel like I am somewhat obliged to do like to support them. 


## Reflection 
I think stepping away from the website and getting a more holistic view was really important. My participatory observation session was really fruitful and I really enjoyed learning more about what a typical person’s interest in the social issue could be. I had a bit of difficulty with coming up with questions at first but once I started thinking about what I was curious about from a user point of view it was a bit easier. Although not much of my conversation was focused on only the website but rather the social issue that The Advocates for Human Rights organization focuses on, it was really important to get a better understanding of how younger people relate to heavier social issues. My participant offered that he was angry and depressed when reading about certain social issues which is something I hadn’t really considered. It might be interesting to approach how these social issues can be more balanced and presented so that it doesn’t consistently elicit such negative effects. One thing that I found extremely useful was the activities where he researched the topic himself. He expressed confusion on how many refugees there actually are in the world and it seemed like there was misinformation so ensuring the information on the website is clear and concise is very important. Having a narrative that introduces the user to the crisis will help dispel misinformation and build credibility. I also discovered that client stories were engaging to my user and he found them to be helpful in connecting to the cause. A lot of the session was very interesting as I got to see some situations where users might want to contribute but can't because of barriers and figuring out how to showcase the website's online volunteering opportunities is something I want to approach as well. Overall, it was a really interesting session that gave me a little bit more insight about the social cause and move away from my own personal biases.
