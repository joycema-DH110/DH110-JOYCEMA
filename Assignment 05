# Assignment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype

DH110: User Experience Design 

## Project Description

My project focuses on developing a platform that allows senior citizens to find senior caregivers easily and efficiently. Because many of the current options are outdated, cluttered, confusing, or not specific enough, I aim to combat all these issues when developing my prototype. The type of user persona I imagine will be using my website/app can be characterized as elderly people who can no longer take care of themselves, who are not super proficient with technology, and who want to look for caregivers themselves instead of asking a friend or family for help. The website/app I aim to build will be helpful and easy for seniors to use themselves. 

The purpose of the low fidelity prototype is to create a general layout of how my platform will look and function. By mapping out the general flow of the screens, I will be able to gain a better understanding of how everything will look in the end and where the problem areas are. By testing the low fidelity prototype, I can see which features are actually functionable and useful and which are confusing and unnecessary. The test will allow me to see my product through the eyes of the user to gain important insight which can be applied to improve user experience. My prototype will go through two tasks that target two problems I noticed in the design of other senior care sites. 


## Tasks
This low-fidelity prototype aims to support these two tasks:

1. Using a specialized filter to help narrow down caregiver options

2. Organizing caregiver profiles to make background information more accessible

## Wireframes and Wireflow

## Prototype Testing 

Both wireframe testing videos can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gD1JWs3l9KELAiOlHeBP5IGmkUFdSoSP/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUeTWztGBFU5JfQkum5VOCzrdpGZ3dkj/view?usp=sharing).

The user was successfully able to complete the tasks presented in the wireframe because the flow was simple and the screens had an obvious progression of events. I did not note much confusion during the testing, and the user seemed to understand what was happening without my help. Overall, the testing was a success. 



## Reflection 
I think the low fidelity prototype testing went very smoothly, because the user was able to complete the tasks quickly and efficiently without raising any concerns. The user did not exhibit confusion while going through the wireframes and was able to follow along with the wireflows and different screens. The reason I kept my flow simple was because my platform is tailored towards senior citizens, many of whom are unfamiliar with technology and would do better with simple processes. I believe by getting rid of excess options and having the user go through the necessary steps in an orderly and simple manner, possible confusion and frustration can be reduced ahead of time. I also learned from this testing session the importance of thinking out every step in the process and making thewireframes as specific as ossible so users can really follow along without getting lost. Overall, the testing went basically as I thought it would go. 

Though my testing went smoothly, I am interested to see if adding more options and allowing for more user freedom and customization would benefit or take away from the app. If I could redo my wireframes, I would make them a little more complex and add more options for users to choose so they feel like they are guiding the interaction, not the app. I originally kept it simple to make it easier for the elderly to navigate, but I think it would be valuable information to retest to guage how complex system interactions can get before seniors start getting confused.
