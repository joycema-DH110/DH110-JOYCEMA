# Caregiver App
## Joyce Ma

### Introduction

This quarter, I centered my project around designing a senior caregiver app for senior citizens. In a world where technology is constantly advancing, it is important to provide senior citizens with platforms to complete necessary tasks that are simple to use, yet up to date with current technology. For my project, I created a new app for the elderly to find suitable caregivers near them that is clean, welcoming, and efficient. The app allows users to complete tasks such as filter caregivers based on requirements, run background checks, and contact potential caregivers. A common flaw the current popular senior caregiver websites and apps share is a cluttered interface that is difficult and confusing to use, so my app aims to simplify and streamline the process of finding a good caregiver for senior citizens.

### Design Statement

For the design of my project, I wanted to focus on creating an interface that is easy for seniors to navigate. The overall design of the app is straightforward and uncluttered, so seniors do not feel overwhelmed when browsing. The two main tasks I wanted to target with my design were creating a specialized filter to help narrow down caregiver options and organizing caregiver profiles to make background information more accessible. 

### Competitor Analysis

The two websites I chose to analyze were displayed on the first page of Google search results, because seniors searching up how to use technology are most likely to click on the first few links they see. As a result, I view these sites as my greatest competitors. The Join Papa site, though it is the first option to click, needs major improvements to successfully teach seniors how to use technology because it lacks important information. The Easy Tech Seniors site, though better than the Join Papa site, could also benefit from formatting changes. Because the Join Papa website addresses so many issues at once, their pages do not talk about the topics comprehensively. On the How to Teach Technoogy to Seniors page, the main issues is the lack of useful information. The information provided is extremely basic and vague, and would not be a good source to turn to for seniors inexperienced with technology.

### User Research

My project is meant to support users by allowing them to browse senior care websites with more ease and confidence. Because technology is oftentimes a challenge for the elderly, I hope my project will serve to improve the accessibility of senior care and help the eldery find what they are looking for efficiently. The current limitations to finding senior care is not having a comprehensive databse of available caregivers in your area to look through. Because caregivers and seniors sign up to different websites and apps, there is a big possibility users are unable to complete list of caregivers they can hire, which can lead to potentially missing out on someone who is perfect for your needs.

**Demographic:** elderly people looking for senior care, friends and family of seniors who want to find their loved ones proper care

**Preference:** users who are genuinely interested in finding senior care and are ready to hire a caregiver

**Expertise:** users do not have to have previous experience or expertise to use this application

The observation method I chose was participatory observation. I had my participant engage in a few activites to see his reaction and his experience with senior care websites. Ideally, my participant would have been an elderly person. Unfortunately, my elderly family members do not speak English and due to the pandemic, I thought it would be best to not reach out to random participants on the street. I thought it was very interesting and helpful to interview someone and guage how they would approach looking for a senior caregiver through observation and asking them questions about their thoughts and opinions. Overall, this experience helped me overcome some personal biases I had regarding senior care websites and I look forward to using the information I gathered to improve my own project.
