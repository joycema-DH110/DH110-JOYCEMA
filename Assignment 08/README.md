# Caregiver App
## Joyce Ma

### Introduction

This quarter, I centered my project around designing a senior caregiver app for senior citizens. In a world where technology is constantly advancing, it is important to provide senior citizens with platforms to complete necessary tasks that are simple to use, yet up to date with current technology. For my project, I created a new app for the elderly to find suitable caregivers near them that is clean, welcoming, and efficient. The app allows users to complete tasks such as filter caregivers based on requirements, run background checks, and contact potential caregivers. A common flaw the current popular senior caregiver websites and apps share is a cluttered interface that is difficult and confusing to use, so my app aims to simplify and streamline the process of finding a good caregiver for senior citizens.
